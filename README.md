# SentinelForge
AI-Powered Web Security Scanner & Penetration Testing Framework

SentinelForge is an advanced AI-driven security scanner designed to automate reconnaissance, vulnerability detection, and exploitation for web applications. It combines machine learning, OSINT automation, and deep security analysis to help ethical hackers and penetration testers efficiently identify security risks.
ğWhy SentinelForge?
 Automated Vulnerability Scanning Detects XSS, SQL Injection, API security flaws, and cloud misconfigurations.
 AI-Enhanced Detectio Uses machine learning to reduce false positives and prioritize critical threats.
 Subdomain & OSINT Recon Automates data gathering from Wayback Machine, certificate logs, and GitHub leaks.
 Cloud & API Security Testing Finds exposed AWS S3 buckets, API endpoints, and authentication flaws.
 Attack Surface Mapping Uses Neo4j to visualize relationships between assets and vulnerabilities.
 Automated Reports Generates detailed, structured HTML reports with recommended fixes.
 Seamless Integration Works with Shodan, WHOIS, AWS, and other security APIs for real-time intelligence.
ğFeatures & Modules
Reconnaissance Suite

    Subdomain Discovery
  Finds hidden subdomains via certificate logs, DNS enumeration, and API integrations.
    Wayback URL Extraction Scrapes historical endpoints from the Wayback Machine for OSINT.
    GitHub & Certificate Analysis  Detects leaked secrets and SSL misconfigurations.

 Vulnerability Scanner

    XSS & SQL Injection Testing Uses smart payloads for automated security testing.
